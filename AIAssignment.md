# Homework 5 AI Synthesis Activity

Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

I summarized my questions and AI interactions in notes.md

### Part 2

I think I'm unfamiliar with the overall structure of dividing backend file components, so it was helpful to ask AI to get a general overview of how files should be structured and what each component should do. It was also helpful when asking questions about libraries or concepts or why certain things have to be used.

### Part 3

I think the AI is good at answering my questions without hallucinating.

### Part 4

Middleware is function that sits in the middle of the request flow. A clean way to implement this is to use the Router() provided with express and call .use method. The middleware allows us to perform certain necessary actions for many routes instead of writing these actions separately for each routes.

## Activity B: You did NOT use AI

### Part 1

> Explain some improvement you want to make within your code. Perhaps you have a code block that could be more concise, or a part of your code could be improved with a library or be performed with a more efficient algorithm.

### Part 2

> Ask AI how to improve your code, by picking a part of your program you are interested in improving and asking something along the lines of "how can I improve this code?" This does not have to be verbatim; you could ask more specific questions for improvement, like "what JavaScript libraries could improve the efficiency of my code?" Screenshot or link the response.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the response the AI generates. You may need to do some research to do this evaluation, to see if the syntax generates correctly or if any libraries the AI suggests are appropriate for the current task. Report on whether the AI's solution fits within your project, or if it would need modifications to work properly.

**_ You do NOT need to use the AI suggestion within your final submission, if your code already works properly. If the scope of your inquiry in this activity leads you to replace parts of your code, switch to the other version of this activity instead. _**
